# Fake-NEWS-classifier-with-LSTM-and-Word-Embedding
# Solution:
## preprocessed the dataset using NLTK and re Libraries to remove punctuation, lowernimg the word.
## applyed  Porter Stemmer technique to after removing Stopwords form the sentences.
## Used One-Hot encoding with pad_sequences to convert Test NEWS Titles into feature vectors.
## Used LSTM RNN technique to get the maximum accuracy.
## Built the Model using Word Embedding layer to get the feature matrix.
## Used LSTM, Dropout and Dense layers to build a Sequential Model.
## Got the Train accuracy of 98%, validation accuracy of 92% and Test accuracy of 91.89%.
